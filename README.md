For "lamda max extractor" for SPR peak of Au or Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles:
  1. Change the path to your xlsx file path
  2. make shure the limits are in the range of the peak (50nm range is mandatory)
  3. Run the script (I used PyCharm for running it)

For "exponential background" for measuring the change in absorbance of 230nm and 240nm peaks of formed [Au(CN)2]-
  1. Create xlsx file which compose of all UV vis titrations (the "data set" file is such an example for this file)
  2. Run the script (I used PyCharm for running it). You can evaluate the results by the residual graphs of each spectra.

Good Luck
